# OpenAI Mega App

A portfolio-ready playground that demonstrates how a product leader could orchestrate the latest
OpenAI APIs within a cohesive experience. The stack combines FastAPI, a polished front-end, and a
SQLite knowledge layer to track every insight, response, and generated asset.

## Features

- **Latest OpenAI responses API** – Routes conversations through `client.responses.create` with
  `gpt-5-chat-latest`, storing every turn in SQLite for recall and storytelling.
- **Generative gallery** – Captures images generated by `gpt-image-1`, organizing them with
  descriptions and metadata for future inspiration.
- **Conversation management** – Spin up new strategy sprints, review historical threads, and keep
  context intact while you iterate on prompts or requirements.
- **Portfolio polish** – Gradient-rich UI/UX, dark-mode friendly, and mobile responsive by default.

## Architecture overview

```
app/
├── main.py              # FastAPI application with HTML + JSON routes
├── openai_client.py     # Wrapper around the latest OpenAI SDK endpoints
├── database.py          # SQLAlchemy models and session helpers
├── schemas.py           # Pydantic models for request/response contracts
├── templates/index.html # Jinja2-powered landing page and workspace shell
└── static/              # CSS and JavaScript powering the interface
```

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env  # optional helper, or export variables manually
   ```
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` – your OpenAI API key.
   - `OPENAI_ORG_ID` – optional organization identifier.
   - `DATABASE_URL` – defaults to `sqlite:///./mega_app.db`.

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Build your product narrative**
   - Create a conversation and ideate with `gpt-5-chat-latest` through the responses API.
   - Generate visuals with the latest `gpt-image-1` endpoint and pin them to the gallery.
   - Everything is persisted in SQLite so you can revisit ideas or prepare stakeholder updates.

### Notes on API versions

All OpenAI interactions use the `openai` Python SDK `1.48.0` (September 2024 release) and the
`client.responses.create` endpoint, which supersedes legacy chat completions. Chat requests default
to `gpt-5-chat-latest`. Image generation follows the documented cURL contract:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-image-1",
    "prompt": "A minimal product hero shot"
  }'
```

Video creation aligns with the new `/v1/videos` endpoint. A minimal example mirrors the app's
server-side helper:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/videos \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -F "model=sora-2" \
  -F "prompt=A calico cat playing a piano on stage"
```

These utilities are orchestrated automatically when the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is
provided to the FastAPI service.

## Roadmap ideas

- Incorporate Realtime API for collaborative prompt jams.
- Add embeddings to cluster gallery assets by thematic similarity.
- Ship product brief exports that merge chats, assets, and metrics into a single narrative.
